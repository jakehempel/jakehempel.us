Some thoughts and findings after a bit of experimentation with how I make my cookies.

# Why?
I would only consider myself a novice baker, but I've been trying to advance my craft a bit. I had always found myself relying on online recipes to product a product that would come out with the right consistency and taste. What a really wanted was to experiment with my own cookies and using ingredients I couldn't find recipes for.

Wanting to experiment with different kinds of ingredients left me with a need for a baseline which I could adjust and work off of to get consistent results. To make things easy, I wanted to use one stick of butter per batch so I specifically experimented around this amount of butter. After many results of various degrees of success, I finally got a good baseline recipe to work off of that consistently produced delicious results that had the correct consistency.

As a result, this page is also for me to use for reference when making cookies.   

# The Recipe
Makes ~18 mid sized cookies

**Ingredients**
 * 1/2 cup of granulated sugar
 * 1/2 cup of brown sugar (I use light)
 * 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter
 * 1 Egg
 * 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract
 * 1.25 cups of flour
 * 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 * 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
 * 1/2 teaspoon of salt

**Directions**
 1. Preheat Oven 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
 2. Cut in/cream together room temperature butter with granulated sugar and brown sugar in bowl.
 3. Break egg into bowl and mix with butter/sugar mixture and add vanilla extract.
 4. In separate bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.
 5. Slowly combine into bowl with sugar mixture, being careful not to overmix.
 6. Roll into balls on top of baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put in oven for 10-12 minutes or when bottoms begin to brown.
 7. Allow time to cool at room temperature.
 8. ???
 9. Enjoy!

# Adjusting

This recipe only produces simple sugar cookies; however it can be adjusted to produce other kinds of flavors as well. Ingredients that aren't meant to be fully mixed in with the dough (i.e. chocolate chips, nuts, coconut shavings) can be added in at the end before putting into the oven. If the ingredient is sweetened, reducing the amount of sugar put into the dough will prevent the final product from being too sweet. Ingredients that will be integrated into the dough (i.e. cocoa powder) will require you to adjust the amount of flour you put in or else the cookies can become dry.

This is what the finished result should look like, soft and chewy! For this particular batch I just folded some chocolate chips into the dough after it was formed to keep it simple.
