This is an ongoing page that I update with the list of books I've read.
This page is meant to be a companion to my new hobby of reading, and chronicle books as I read them.

This list represents books that I have read recently and/or still remain in my mind long after reading them.
That said, this list will **not** include books that I have read and subsequently forgot about in high school.

- Balor, Paul -- Manual of the Mercenary Soldier
- Carnegie, Dale -- How to Win Friends and Influence People
- Hayden, Micheal -- Playing to the Edge
- Kabat-Zinn, John -- Mindfulness Meditation for Everyday Life
- Machiavelli, Niccolo -- The Prince
- McCarthy, Cormac -- The Road
- Sun Tzu -- The Art of War
- Thoreau, Henry David -- Walden
