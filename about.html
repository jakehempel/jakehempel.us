<h2>Personal</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Northern New Jersey in a medium-sized suburban town. As a child from a divorced family I spent many summer days home-alone left with the home-computer and my own curiosity.</p>

<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
<p>I would like to consider myself somewhat of a polymath: one whose expertise lies in a myraid of different activities. Over the years I've picked up many different hobbies and dabbled in many more. Here are some things I like to do in no particular order.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>Since I was young enough to use a computer, I've been an avid gaming enthusiast. I've always been fascenated by the possibilites presented by a virtual world in which all parameters and rules can be adjusted to create unique experiences. While I love all kinds of games, I mainly prefer FPS's and survival horror games as those games tend to be more immersive and engaging. A more much detailed list of games I like can be found <a href="games.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I like to do a lot of reading on a myraid of secular topics and enjoy technical reading. In particular, I like to read about technology news, history, and politics. I also enjoy reading fiction from time to time, with some of my favorite genres being post apocalyptic and sci-fi.</p>

<h4>Cooking</h4>
<p>My mother and father had always tried to emphasize how much of an important skill cooking was, to which they were right. Once I had moved off campus during university and no longer had the convenience of the dining hall's ready-made food I knew I had to learn how to feed myself on a budget while satisfying my bottomless pit of a stomache. Ever since then most of the meals I consume are prepared by myself with the help of my trusty cast iron skillet. My preferred style of food is tex-mex because of how delicious and hearty most meals are.

<h4>Fitness</h4>
<p>Before university I was nowhere near being fit or at a healthy bodyweight, but all of that changed when I signed onto my univerity's Air Force ROTC program. The countless mornings broke my body but rebuilt it into a stronger, healthier person. Even though I eventually was medically discharged, I continued the habit of trying to stay healthy and active so I can live a better life. My workouts consist of running for my cardio and bodyweight gymnastics/parkour training for my strength and flexibility. </p>

<h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Although I am nowhere near the skill level of a professional software developer, I enjoy solving problems and implementing ideas with the help of programming. I'm mostly familiar with python and java, but enjoy learning a new language when the need for it arises. In fact, I built this website entirely from scratch.

<h4>Shooting</h4>
<p>Ever since I was young, I had an interest in shooting sports. It all started with my Red Ryder BB gun shooting cans in my father's backyard, and still continues to this day except with bigger toys. I enjoy target shooting as well as skeet shooting as a way of getting out of the house and practicing my marksmanship.</p>

<h4>Gardening</h4>
<p>I began gardening during my late college years. Gardening for me is a destressor as pruning my plants and harvesting them for various purposes is somewhat therapeutic to me. Here is a picture of my herb garden at it's prime.</p>
