<h4>About Me</h4>
My name is Jake Hempel. I'm a 25 year old IT professional currently based in Pennsylvania in the greater Philadelphia area. I spent most of my life growing up in the North Jersey area and attended Rutgers University at the New Brunswick campus for my undergraduate degree of Information Technology and Informatics.

<h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
A short, non-exhaustive list of some things I'm interested in:

**Gaming** -- I've always been a PC gamer for almost my whole life. I tend to prefer games that challenge reflex like First Person Shooters and strategy games to keep my mind sharp. Some games I like include World of Warcraft, The Half Life series, and Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and Dark Souls.

**Internet Archeology** -- Scouring the net trying to uncover the strangest websites and information people thought was important enough to put on the web, some not even known to Google.

**DIY** -- Very generally speaking, I like to be handy with tools and being able to both create and fix things for myself.

**Cooking** -- Man's gotta eat, right?

**Gardening** -- Man's gotta eat, so might as well get fresh herbs to accompany my cooking.

**3D Modeling** -- Mainly for personal projects in tandem with the two other hobbies down below.

**3D Printing** -- The days of 2D printing are over, grandpa. A handy skill to have to see my 3D models be brought into the real world.

**Electronics** -- I try to be handy with a soldering iron so I can create devices for both utility and amusement.

**Linux** -- Take back your freedom in computing with humanity's open source operating system. If you're new, I suggest checking out [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). Learn more about the principals behind free (as in freedom) software at the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/).
