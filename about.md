<h4>Background</h4>
I was born and raised in Northern New Jersey, bouncing between several suburban towns in the area. I grew up in the late 90's/early 2000's alongside the Internet and Web 2.0; as a result many long summers were spent mucking about on the family computer which culminated with me taking an interest with how it all worked. Luckily for me, that intellectual pursuit turned out to be a marketable set of skills years later.

<h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
I've picked up many different hobbies and dabbled in many more. I suppose one could say one of my umbrella hobbies would be learning, since I enjoy sitting down and reading about a new skill I'm interested in. Here are a list of some things I like to do in no particular order:

**Gaming** -- I've always been an avid gaming enthusiast ever since I was able to use a computer. The possibilities of a virtual world in which all parameters and rules can be adjusted to create unique experiences was also a fascenating prospect to me both for entertainment and as a teaching tool. While I love all kinds of games, I mainly find myself interested in first person shooters and survival horror games for the immersion factor those kinds of game have.

**Reading** -- Recreational reading is a relatively recent interest for me. In the past I have always read for information; however I've learned to enjoy sitting down from time to time to take some time to actively read. In particular, I like to read about current events technology, history, politics, or any secular topic I may find myself interested in at the time. I also enjoy reading fiction occasionally, with some of my favorite genres being post apocalyptic and science fiction.

**Cooking** -- My mother and father had always tried to emphasize how much of an important skill cooking was, to which I realize in my 20's that they had a point. Once I had moved off campus during university and no longer had the convenience of the dining hall's ready-made food I knew I had to learn how to feed myself on a budget while satisfying my bottomless pit of a stomach. Most of the meals I consume are prepared by myself with the help of my trusty cast iron skillet,  dutch oven, and slow cooker. My preferred style of food is Tex-Mex because of how delicious and hearty most meals are.

**Gardening** -- I began gardening during my late college years. Gardening for me is a de-stressor: pruning my plants and harvesting them for various purposes is a therapeutic activity for me. Here is a picture of my herb garden at it's prime.

**Fitness** -- I went into university was nowhere near being fit or at a healthy bodyweight, but all of that changed when I enrolled into my university's Air Force ROTC program. The countless mornings of physical training broke my body but rebuilt it into a stronger, healthier person. Despite my eventual medical discharge, the liked the healthy feeling I got from routine exercise and chose to stick with it to continue to live a healthy lifestyle. For my cardio I like to do a lot of outdoor running since I find treadmills as well as other stationary forms of cardio to be boring. To build strength, coordination, and flexibility I do Parkour training, which encompasses a lot running, climbing, gymnastics, and calisthenics. I find this kind of exercise the easiest to stick with because it allows me to get outside, it requires no special equipment, can be done anywhere, and most importantly it's quite a lot of fun!

**Linux** -- I started dabbling in Linux around 2012 when I got a Raspberry Pi as a Christmas present. The Raspberry Pi was a valuable learning platform that I learned the ropes of using Linux Systems. As I learned more about the system I was using progressively dove deeper into the Unix Design Philosophy as well as the philosophies of the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and learned to appreciate the software ideology of 'the Linux way of doing things.' Today I maintain various servers for personal use including personal cloud storage, the web server this site is running on, among other services.

**Programming** -- Although I am nowhere near the skill level of a professional software developer, I enjoy problem solving and implementing my ideas with the help of programming.  I'm most familiar with Python and Java, however I'm always open to learning new language if they are better suited to the problem I am trying to solve. In fact, this website initially was an excuse for me to sharpen my full-stack web development skills.

**Gunnery** -- My interested in shooting sports started with shooting cans in my father's back yard with my Red Ryder BB gun. Today that still continues, except with bigger toys. I find it to be a good reason to get out of the house and very therapeutic hobby to go to the range to hone my skills; however I also see general weapons handling skills a generally handy skillset to have in the case of an emergency. I like to do bit of skeet shooting with my 12 gauge shotgun and plinking/sharpshooting with my .22 rifle. I also have a hunting license and an interest in hunting for food, but as of right now I have no means of storing large amounts of meat.

**3D Printing** -- 3D Printing has always been an interest of mine, the idea of having a device that can create 3D objects in my home seemed very useful and handy to have. Around September 2020 I acquired an Ender 3 Pro as my first 3D printer. Learning how to create 3D objects in software such as [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) and in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) has been a whole lot of fun and has taught me a lot about 3D design in general. As someone who likes to regularly play Tabletop games, I also enjoy printing out miniature models and painting them to be used for play.
