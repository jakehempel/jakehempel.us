I recently had become somewhat of a tea addict. For most of my life I couldn't stand the taste of most teas and would rather just drink water or some other flavored beverage of choice. However, recently I realized that as my flavor palate had developed more through my college years I wanted to revisit tea to see if I would like it.

Needless to say, if I hadn't enjoyed it I wouldn't be writing this post about expanding my horizons.

After discovering that I now had a taste for tea, I began trying some of the more mainstream varieties of tea that I found at my local grocery store. It started with the usual: Earl Grey,  English Breakfast, Green Tea, the works. However, I wanted to explore the vast world of tea.

So I decided that the best way to do that would be to look for a sampler which had a multitude of flavors and see if anything in particular really stood out fo me. I found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075F9Y19M/">this Twinings Tea sampler</a> on Amazon with a whole 48 different varities of tea bags. Today, I got that sampler in the mail.

So, I'm writing this to document my experience with each of the different tea bags so I can learn more about what kind of tea I like.

#### My List of some of the notable the Teas I've tried, in no particular order.

* **Honeybush, Mandarin, and Organge Herbal Tea** - Very smooth and refreshing with citrusy undertones. Taste reminds me somewhat of the Hot Tamales candy. Wouldn't mind buying more of this.

* **Twinings Nightly Calm Herbal** - This was actually a very pleasant combination of camomile, spearmint, and lemongrass. It was a great tea to relax myself before bed. Definitely will be getting more.

* **Dajeerling** - Kind of middle of the road. Not necessarily great but definitely not bad either. Taste kind of me of a mixture between green and black tea.

* **Earl Grey w/ Jasmine** - Very nice adaptation of normal Earl Grey. Had a very pleasant aroma. I think I'm going to try more variations of Earl Grey with other aromatics.

* **Rooibos Tea** - Very interesting flavor these had to them. I can't really compare it to any other kind of tea I've tried. From what I've gathered, it's not a derivative of the tea plant, rather some kind of pine-like plant from South Africa. I drank it straight without any additives and thought it was interesting, but not great either. Might taste better with lemon or milk added.

* **Twinings Flavored Black Tea (Mixed Berry, Blackcurrant Breeze, Lemon Twist)** - All of these are fantastic. Every flavor of these black teas are a nice tea to complement an evening treat or if you want a flavored drink. Out of the bunch, Mixed Berry has the best and strongest flavor, but Blackcurrant Breeze was a very close second.

* **White Tea** - Reminded me a lot of flavor and aroma of green tea, except had a lighter and smoother taste. I think I prefer green tea better, but still good nonetheless.

* **Pure Chamomile** - Another great evening drink when you're getting ready for bed. The aroma of chamomile is very pleasant at night and helps get cozy.
