This post is the first of (what could end up being) many more posts documenting the development of this website.

From the very beginning, I never wanted this site to be anything spectacular. I merely wanted a place that I could put my thoughts from pen to paper as well as a place to document any projects I have worked on for anyone who may be interested. Most particularly, I just wanted some kind of stable online presence that wasn't attached to a social media site and their darn data farming.

I never wanted this site to be anything spectacular either.  I feel like a lot of my philosophy on web design are much better explained by <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website<a/>. Although I understand why many sites choose to put a lot of time and effort into sophisticated presentation, I'd like to think of this website in a much more utilitarian way.

Mainly, I see the function of a website is to disseminate information and/or facilitate a service.  To make sure that this primary objective is achieved, all over overhead must be keep to a minimum. 'Overhead' in this could mean anything that either impedes the client getting the information they want, whether it be longer load times or inaccessability issues. With that in mind, I tried to deliberately design this website to be as simple as possible.

I began like any amateur web developer: wrote up an index.html file. I made a rough draft with how I want the basic design to be and put together a universal css file to adjust the styling. I used this html rough draft as a template and began hard-coding some pages with content and see how I liked the way everything looked. I also decided that, despite what I said in my original design philosophy, I wanted to fiddle with some jQuery to see how it worked. After scouring through the documentation, I eventually found myself happy with the simple three button setup to open and close link menus.

All scripting fun aside, I had to face a real concern going foreward with this project: how I was going to run a blog-style site with static HTML. I knew I didn't want to use a CMS like Wordpress or Drupal because I thought it was a bit too much javascript overhead. I wanted to stick to the basics, but I needed a CMS-like framework to make it much easier for myself in the longrun if I wanted to use this platform to blog so I didn't have to hard code every page I wanted to write.

Well, after some research I found the perfect solution for my predicament: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static HTML generator that is "blog aware." From what I gathered, that basically means that it supports tagging and dynamically generating lists of blog posts; exactly what I was looking for.

After taking some time to get used to it and to scour through the docs, I am quite fond of Jekyll. I particularly enjoy the modular design similar to that of Drupal, where you can have layouts (views) that can display all associated pages (content). It'll then generate all of the pages from the user-designated framework, ready to be synced up with my http server's web directory.

Overall I think I have a good foundation so far, after several days of developing in my free time. I want to further iron out the website and decide what kind of information I think  is important enough to put up as static pages as well as tweaking the overall site design. There are a lot of small things I am eager to work on, but what matters most importantly though is I try to regularly document my thoughts throughout development in diaries like these. After all, that is the point of a blog, right?
