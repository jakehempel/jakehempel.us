My home lab recently has gotten a lot of upgrades that have really broughy my home environment up to a whole new level.

The days of the humble Raspberry Pi homelab + whatever-spare-computer-I-Had are quite over, as I've recently had some great hardware upgrades that really allow me to do much more. Introducing my new workhorse in my closet datacenter -- my Dell Poweredge R410!

## The Hardware

With dual *Intel Xeon E5630's*, *32 gigabytes of RAM*, and *4 1tb hard drives in RAID 5* my Poweredge is quite **beefy** compared to what my home lab has been in the past, and I've been trying to take full advantage of all the power available to me. I decided that to get more hand-on experience using VMware Hypervisors and to make full use of my new workhorse I installed VMware ESXI and turned my entire home network into virtual machines.

Currently as of October of 2020 I've currently got 5 servers running on my ESXI host: my NAS/media server (which originally existed on my Raspberry Pi), a Windows Server and an Ubuntu Server in which I use to host various servers as I need them, a jump-box which I use to securely connect into my home network, and a guest running Kali Linux which I use as my lab machine for cyber security research/practice.

## The Lab

My NAS serves as my personal file repository which I keep most of my data, all in an encrypted container in case of theft. For data redundancy I more or less do the same thing as my previous NAS (as detailed [here](/projects/2019/02/09/website_pt3.html)) where I Rsync my data onto an encrypted external drive in case my RAID array breaks for whatever reason. Since I had a spare hard drive as well, I decided to make monthly backups onto a cold-storage drive I keep in a fireproof safe when not in use in case any disaster happens in my home my data is still somewhat secure. Perhaps storing some of my data off-site might be prudent, but I think this is fine for my purposes. This server also hosts a bit-torrent server which I use for large downloads as well as for streaming using the software [Emby](https://emby.media/). While most people like to use [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), I found it quite ridiculous that you need to create an online Plex account in order to use Plex locally. Emby appears to offer all the same functionality as Plex without forcing me to create an account on their website just to use locally-installed software. So far, it's been quite nice being able to stream media from my NAS directly onto the Chromecast attached to me TV.

My jump-box has been the other most recent development in my Home Lab. I was looking for simple and secure methods of accessing my networks. I considered making it into an OpenVPN server, but I've found that the configuration process for OpenVPN is quite tricky and I wanted a solution which I could use to connect to my servers from anywhere without any installation. I found [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) was a solution that also appealed to me, but it had a lot of features that I wasn't going to use on it and I'd prefer not to have a web-site hosted on my home network open to the public internet due to potential security vulnerabilities that could be discovered in the future. What I eventually settled on was leveraging **SSH Tunneling** to act as my gateway into my home network and to remotely forward ports to whatever service I needed. SSH Tunneling paired with only having key-based SSH authentication enabled on my jump-box fit my criteria of simple and secure remote connection.

My Windows and Ubuntu server aren't particularly interesting, they are simply there in case I need to host any server software for personal uses. My Kali guest isn't much more interesting either, it's just a host I can use for cybersecurity labbing.  

## The Network

To complement this new hardware, I also elected to purchase gigabit internet for my home and I regret absolutely nothing. Having gigabit internet for my desktop and servers has generally made my online has certainly been worth the money I pay for it with how quickly I can download large files and browse the web.

## Final Thoughts

Having a whole server to myself has been quite a power-trip for an IT hobbyist/professional like myself. Having all of these computing resources to myself has really expanded my ability to experiment with different ways of architecting my home environment as well as giving me ample resources to create a lab environment for myself to get more hands-on experience which will greatly help me in my IT career moving forward.
