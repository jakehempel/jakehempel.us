To me, nothing can match the practicality and the versatility of the renowned Victornix Swiss Army Knife. This post is a a love letter of sorts to one of my favorite multi-tools that I've ever owned.

Since my early teens I've browsed EDC forums dedicated to discussing the various items people carry on a daily basis -- the acronym EDC standing for Every Day Carry. The objects of discussion typically include pocket knives, flashlights, watches, or wallets but can also extend to other things typically carried on a daily basis like headphones, pens, or lighters. Over the years I've developed my own "Every Day Carry" -- a collection of handy items that I almost never leave my home without. This post is dedicated to the one tool that has always had a special place in my heart: the Swiss Army Knife by Victornox.

# My History with Swiss Army Knives

My first exposure to the Swiss Army Knife was when I was in Cub Scouts during a camping trip where my father gave me my first Swiss Army Knife. I found myself fascinated by the various tools and functions packed into one sleek, red package. Not too long after I had put it to good use whittling a crude looking wooden statue out of a small log using every tool this small knife had attached to it. The feeling of having all the right tools for the job really made me appreciate the versatility that this multi-tool offered and made me feel ready for any problems life had in store for me.

As I grew into my late teens I began to desire something that was a bit "cooler" than the Swiss Army Knife: the rabbit-foot blade didn't look all that impressive and you had to use two hands to deploy the knife -- which to me back then was totally lame compared to the other knives that you could flick open with one hand like a badass. From there I went through a few good folders, both manual and assisted-opening, and got some good use out of them. However, near my senior year of college realized I had lost track of the original Swiss Army Knife I got as a young boy and decided I should purchase another one that I'd take good care of. I found a cheap one that had all of the tools I wanted off of eBay and instantly fell in love again after opening the package.

Above are the two Swiss Army Knives I currently carry daily, the larger one (the Climber model) I carry in my pocket and the smaller one (the Rambler model) I carry on my keychain. After I had originally gotten it I had mostly kept within my home for various domestic tasks, but over time I eventually began favoring it over my dedicated pocket knife for the reasons I'm about to list below.

# My Thoughts on Swiss Army Knives

Overall I believe the Swiss Army Knife everyone should own a Swiss Army Knife, even if they don't want to carry it around. With a large number of models available all outfitted with different permutations of tools, everyone can find a Swiss Army Knife that can service their daily needs effectively.

It perfectly embodies the phrase "jack of all trades and master of none." While there may be better dedicated pocket knives with better blade shape and composition, and there may be multitools such as the venerated Leatherman brand of multitools that are better suited for heavier and more involved tasks; the Swiss Army Knive strikes a perfect balance between practicality, ease of carry, and budget. While a dedicated folding knife may have a blade that is more effective than the standard rabbit-foot blade on a Swiss Army Knife, it lacks the practicality of having an assortment of handy tools that Swiss Army Knives offer such as bottle openers, scissors, or screwdrivers. Likewise while dedicated multitools like the Leatherman may offer a more versatile assortment of tools they can sometimes be a bit too superfluous for daily tasks and only add extra weight onto the tool. The mixture of practicality, light weight, and sleek form factor make it ideal for every day carry. My only real complaint about the series of knives is *how* sleek the design is: the smooth plastic furniture coupled with the lack of a pocket clip make it shift around in my pocket throughout the day, however the paracord lanyard I attached to it helps me fish it out of my pocket when I need it so it's not too bad.

I think Swiss Army Knives are the best bang-for-your-buck multitool on the market and I'd encourage anyone to buy one, even if they don't intend on carrying it since it's handy to have around the house. At a price point around ~$30 for a standard full-sized model on Amazon there's no reason not to own one.
