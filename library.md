This is an ongoing page that I update with the list of books I've read.
This page is meant to be a companion to my new hobby of reading, and chronicle books as I read them.

This list represents books that I have read recently and/or still remain in my mind long after reading them.
That said, this list will **not** include books that I have read and subsequently forgot about in high school.

- Balor, Paul -- Manual of the Mercenary Soldier
- Brynjolfsson, Eric and McAfee, Andrew -- The Second Machine Age
- Carnegie, Dale -- How to Win Friends and Influence People
- Comer, Douglas -- Computer Networks and Internets
- Hayden, Micheal -- Playing to the Edge
- Kabat-Zinn, John -- Mindfulness Meditation for Everyday Life
- Kigma, Bruce -- The Economics of Information
- Koren, Leonard and Goodman, Peter -- Hagglers Handbook
- Machiavelli, Niccolo -- The Prince
- McCarthy, Cormac -- The Road
- Sun Tzu -- The Art of War
- Thoreau, Henry David -- Walden
