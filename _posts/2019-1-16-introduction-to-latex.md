I had recently decided to update my resume, however instead of sticking with the Microsoft Word template I had I opted to take the opportunity to learn a new markup language, LaTeX.

Making a resume in Microsoft Word surely gets the job done, it's relatively easy to search for some free template online and fill in the blanks with my own information. That's essentially how I did it for the first few iterations of my Resume. But eventually this approach can get a bit finicky as too much text content can begin bleeding into other parts of the document. The end result? Something very sloppy looking, certainly not something I'd give to a prospective employer.

LaTeX has been a solution to this problem for me, as it allows me to focus more about the content that I want to post and then manipulate the markup and styling later in a way that's uniform and cleaner. When I was using my MS word method of writing my Resume, I found myself adding/subtracting content in it to fit the size of the text box it was in. The end result was me having to sacrifice content for style.

LaTeX is described as a typesetting system. Where it differs from word processors like word is the way the styling is applied to the document. I believe the LaTeX's website's <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/about/LaTeX"> about page</a> states the difference best. In short, instead of the document's content going into a word processor program and having all of the style being modified by hand through the word processor's GUI, LaTeX is a markup language can be written amongst the content of the text to section off various parts of the document. What's great about LaTeX is that it essentially allows one write the 'skeleton' of a paper and focus on the content and then either tweak the styling later oneself or find a styling template and applying it to the skeleton. This is especially useful for drafting up documents en-masse, such as articles or technical documentation, since the styling template has to be done just once and it can be applied to all similar documents moving forward.

However, there is no doubt that LaTeX had some degree of a learning curve, at least for me. Since it's an extendable markup language, a lot of the useful functionality and styling was done by extensions. This means that when I'm trying to reference commands I have to have several different sets of documentation open, one for each extension I use as well as a base guide for LaTeX markup.

I originally was told to find a LaTeX template online and replace it with all of my own information and call it a day. However, I decided to take the opportunity to learn a handy tool and build my own resume from scratch. With the help of the <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/latex.html"> tutorial on Luke Smith's website </a> (I would reccommend anyone check out his website and multimedia content, he's a cool guy) I got a simple TexLive setup on my Debian Thinkpad and got to work referencing his videos on resume building as well as the documentation for LaTeX. Within time, I had a skeleton for my resume built and all I needed was to tweak the styling to my liking.

Overall, my experience learning LaTeX was tough at first but rewarding to stick with. I feel like I have a solid grasp on this robust document-preparation system and can see myself using it in the future for purposes such as writing documentation or college papers.
